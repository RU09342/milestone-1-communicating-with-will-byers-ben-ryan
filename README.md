# Choosing the Board
In order to make the difficult decision between 5 different boards delving into the hardware and datasheet is necessary. In the end the MSP430F5529 was chosen. 
The 5529 has 5 Capture Compare Registers that are all on the same port, 1, and are easily accessible to the others. If additional functionality is made there are 2 buttons on different ports and could potentially be useful.
